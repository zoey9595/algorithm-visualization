This is a simple algorithm visualizer project inspired by [clementmihailescu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g). The main idea is to practice JavaScript skills and review some popular sorting algorithms.

And you could change the array size and display speed using the top right slider.

## How to play with it on your local computer?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
